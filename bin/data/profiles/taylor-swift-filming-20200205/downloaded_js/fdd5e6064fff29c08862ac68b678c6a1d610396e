She is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. At age 14, Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house and, at age 15, she signed her first record deal. Her 2006 eponymous debut album was the longest-charting album of the 2000s in the US. Its third single, \"Our Song\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the pop crossover success of the singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\", it became the US's best-selling album of 2009 and was certified diamond in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, and Swift became the youngest Album of the Year winner.","Answer":"","AbstractURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift","AbstractSource":"Wikipedia","Entity":"{{flatlist|, singer-songwriter, record producer, music video director, actress
